## generate word docx in java

I more triedÂ some stuff out and collected bookmarks for it.
But for creating word docx I found this opensource library:
- https://github.com/Sayi/poi-tl
It has a lot of examples and works by using a preformatted word .docx template file which has placeholders in the document. It will be loaded into a java program and replaces the placeholders with data from the backend and compiles to target folder in the examples.
There is even a specific resume example as reference.

- https://github.com/Sayi/poi-tl/blob/master/poi-tl/src/test/java/com/deepoove/poi/tl/example/ResumeExample.java

Otherwise there are some other libraries with less documentation like Apache Poi:

Here are also some libraries mentioned:

This library I haven't tried yet, but sounded good.

Docx4j exists also but I couldn't get it working very advanced in the short time.

- https://www.baeldung.com/docx4j
- https://www.docx4java.org/trac/docx4j
- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.docx4j/docx4j

Enterprise version or what's supposed should be of docx4j:
